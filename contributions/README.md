# Contributions Archive
These are contributions and archived files that are used in other themes where I am not the primary maintainer.
* **Monochrome Contributions** The Monochrome theme is the default theme for RetroArch and Lakka. I have decided to contribute as needed, with a focus on adding new icons as cores are supported. This helps maintain parity with my other theme contributions and gives developers a complete set of icons to work with. Most contributions are adaptations of RetroActive icons.  I find it only fitting since RetroActive began as a project to colorize the monochrome theme icon set.
* **RetroActive Marked Alternative Icon Set** contain logos to represent the emulator core and stand-alone application projects. They also contain parody logos for the systems they represent. The labels are designed to mimic the style of the original system while highlighting the adaptive abilities of the Libretro project. Because it's incomplete, Marked is only implemented as an alternative icon set and cannot be selected from the XMB.
