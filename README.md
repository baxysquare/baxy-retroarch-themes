# BAXY Themes for Libretro/Lakka/RetroArch
The following files are the complete archive of the themes created for the Libretro project that end up in the Lakka OS and RetroArch App. 
## Contributions Archive
These are contributions and archived files that are used in other themes where I am not the primary maintainer. The icons can be found in the **contributions** directory.
## Unified By Theme Elements
In an effort to  create a unified structure that will support all RetroArch UIs, directories and files have been restructured for simplicity and scalability.  The backgrounds, fonts, icons, palettes, scripts and sounds can be found in the **bytheme** directory.
# FlatUX
* The RetroActive icons have their borders removed and have received the expanded FlatUI color palette to become the FlatUX theme. This theme is intended to merge with and replace the FlatUI and RetroActive themes.
# BAXY Matic Series
* **Systematic Icons** use a top-down system icon to represent every system rather than controller to represent the system at the top level of the UI. This brings consistency to the design. It contains a multitude of alternative system icons as well.
* **Automatic Icons** take the Systematic icons and displays them in a white outline in a simplified format.
# Retired BAXY Active Series
* **RetroActive Retired Icons** were the flagship design of the Active series. The set was designed to give users an alternative to Kivutar's Monochrome theme by providing a quality full-color theme for the XMB. The set was spun off of RetroActive Marked in order to provide a clean user experience. RetroActive icons avoid branding unless it's necessary for recognizability.
* **NeoActive Retired Icons** applied a subtle grayscale gradient toward the white end of the spectrum. They are meant to blend the strengths of Kivutar's Monochrome theme and the RetroActive theme.
