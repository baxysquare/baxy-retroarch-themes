# BAXY Themes for Libretro/Lakka/RetroArch
The following files are the complete archive of the themes created for the Libretro project that end up in the Lakka OS and RetroArch App.
## Contributions Archive
These are contributions and archived files that are used in other themes where I am not the primary maintainer.
## Unified Theme Elements
In an effort to  create a unified structure that will support all RetroArch UIs, directories and files have been restructured for simplicity and scalability.
