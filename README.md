# BAXY Themes for Libretro/Lakka/RetroArch
The following files are the complete archive of the themes created for the Libretro project that end up in the Lakka OS and RetroArch App. The icons can be found in the **contributions** directory.
## Contributions Archive
These are contributions and archived files that are used in other themes where I am not the primary maintainer.
## Unified Theme Elements
In an effort to  create a unified structure that will support all RetroArch UIs, directories and files have been restructured for simplicity and scalability.  The backgrounds, fonts, icons, palettes, scripts and sounds can be found in the **uni** directory.
