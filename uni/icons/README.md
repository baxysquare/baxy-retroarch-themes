# BAXY Themes for Libretro/Lakka/RetroArch
The following files are the complete archive of the themes created for the Libretro project that end up in the Lakka OS and RetroArch App.

## BAXY Active Series
* **RetroActive Theme** is the flagship design of the Active series. The theme was designed to give users an alternative to Kivutar's Monochrome theme by providing a quality full-color theme for the XMB. The theme was spun off of RetroActive Marked in order to provide a clean user experience. RetroActive icons avoid branding unless it's necessary for recognizability.
* **RetroActive Marked Alternative Icon Set** contain logos to represent the emulator core and stand-alone application projects. They also contain parody logos for the systems they represent. The labels are designed to mimic the style of the original system while highlighting the adaptive abilities of the Libretro project. Because it's incomplete, Marked is only implemented as an alternative icon set and cannot be selected from the XMB.
* **NeoActive Theme** applies a subtle grayscale gradient toward the white end of the spectrum. It is meant to blend the strengths of Kivutar's Monochrome theme and the RetroActive theme. 
## BAXY Matic Series
* **Systematic Theme** uses a top-down system icon to represent every system rather than controller to represent the system at the top level of the XMB. This brings consistency to the design. It contains a multitude of alternative system icons as well.
* **Automatic Theme** takes the Systematic icons and displays them in a white outline in a simplified format.

## Monochrome Contributions
The Monochrome theme is the default theme for RetroArch and Lakka. I have decided to contribute as needed, with a focus on adding new icons as cores are supported. This helps maintain parity with my other theme contributions and gives developers a complete set of icons to work with.
