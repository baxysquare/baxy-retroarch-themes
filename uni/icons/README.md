# BAXY Icons for Libretro/Lakka/RetroArch
The following files are the complete archive of the themes created for the Libretro project that end up in the Lakka OS and RetroArch App.

## BAXY Active Series
* **RetroActive Icons** are the flagship design of the Active series. The set was designed to give users an alternative to Kivutar's Monochrome theme by providing a quality full-color theme for the XMB. The set was spun off of RetroActive Marked in order to provide a clean user experience. RetroActive icons avoid branding unless it's necessary for recognizability.
* **NeoActive Icons** apply a subtle grayscale gradient toward the white end of the spectrum. They are meant to blend the strengths of Kivutar's Monochrome theme and the RetroActive theme. 
## BAXY Matic Series
* **Systematic Icons** use a top-down system icon to represent every system rather than controller to represent the system at the top level of the UI. This brings consistency to the design. It contains a multitude of alternative system icons as well.
* **Automatic Icons** take the Systematic icons and displays them in a white outline in a simplified format.
