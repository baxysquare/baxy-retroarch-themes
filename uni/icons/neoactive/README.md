NeoActive Theme for RetroArch & Lakka
====================

About NeoActive
-----------------

Building on the work from the RetroActive theme, NeoActive applies a subtle grayscale gradient toward the white end of the spectrum.  It is meant to blend the strengths of the Monochrome and RetroActive themes 


Guidelines
----------

### Palette

 * Icons use grayscale gradient set from 20% gray to white.  Gradients are angled at alternating 135 and -45 degree angles to simulate shadows.  To add maximum contrast, white highlights and 40% gray shadows are applied to optimize recognition.
 * Unlike RetroActive icons, NeoActive icons do not have a border.
 * Translucency is discouraged. 

### Layout

 * The design should be easily recognizable.
 * The icons should be set to a 256x256 canvas and should be centered on a 64x64 grid. Snap design elements to the grid wherever possible to provide maximum clarity and scalability.
 * The maximum icon size is 232x232 centered on the canvas.
 
### Style

 * The level of detail is expanded beyond the scope of the monochrome theme, but favors gradients instead of a flat design.

### Export
When converting from PDF source files, the SVG files can be created using [Alfrixâ€™s conversion script] (https://forums.libretro.com/t/neoactive-retroactive-and-systematic-theme-support-and-feedback/9501/26) and PNG files are converted via the ImageMagick Mogrify command (mogrify -density 288 -resize 25% -format png *.pdf).
