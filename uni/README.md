# Unified Theme Elements
In an effort to  create a unified structure that will support all RetroArch UIs, directories and files have been restructured for simplicity and scalability.
## BAXY Active Series
* **RetroActive Theme** is the flagship design of the Active series. The theme was designed to give users an alternative to Kivutar's Monochrome theme by providing a quality full-color theme for the XMB. The theme was spun off of RetroActive Marked in order to provide a clean user experience. RetroActive icons avoid branding unless it's necessary for recognizability.
* **NeoActive Theme** applies a subtle grayscale gradient toward the white end of the spectrum. It is meant to blend the strengths of Kivutar's Monochrome theme and the RetroActive theme. 
## BAXY Matic Series
* **Systematic Theme** uses a top-down system icon to represent every system rather than controller to represent the system at the top level of the XMB. This brings consistency to the design. It contains a multitude of alternative system icons as well.
* **Automatic Theme** takes the Systematic icons and displays them in a white outline in a simplified format.
