# Unified Theme Elements
In an effort to  create a unified structure that will support all RetroArch UIs, directories and files have been restructured for simplicity and scalability. Within each theme, UI elements have been separated into directories for backgrounds, icons and source. At the root level, the following elements have been unified for use across all themes:
* cfg - configuration files
* devtools - template and palette files
* fonts - typefaces for general use
* scripts - for conversion and organization
* sounds - sfx and bg music
